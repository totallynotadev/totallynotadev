**Additional Notes**
- From start to getting your Certified Flight Instructors license at a steady rate will take you nearly 12 months
- From Certified Flight Instructors License to the Airlines will take you another 12 months
- Total amount of time from 0 at a steady rate = 24 Months (2 Years)
- These estimates can be reduced by flying more and flying longer, amongst other things.
- Flying less adds more time to the estimates
